            Fractal is a non-profit organization that aims to increase educational opportunities in computers science for underprivileged groups such as low-income communities. We do this by creating educational content that is designed to be a concise but thorough introduction to fundamental computer science concepts that are necessary for our scholars to succeed in university or industry. Additionally, we partner with top companies to create a mentorship experience for our scholars.

                Why Does Fractal Exist?
            </h2>
            <p class="body-text text-left">
                Low-income communities see massive underrepresentation in higher education which is only worse when one looks at computer science education. Yet these communities are still massive consumers of the same technology used by everybody else, and proper representation of these consumers is necessary for democratized technological innovation. It is therefore imperative that efforts be made to increase representation from underprivileged communities.

                Recently, massive strides have been made to increase representation for females and underrepresented minorities, while comparatively little effort has been made to increase representation from low-income and underprivileged communities. While these groups often overlap, it is important to directly address the fact that low-income and underprivileged communities have very little access to computer science education, and STEM education more broadly, compared to higher earning communities.
