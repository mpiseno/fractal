        </h2>
        <p class="body-text text-left">
            Low-income communities see massive underrepresentation in higher education which is only worse when one looks at computer science education. Yet these communities are still massive consumers of the same technology used by everybody else, and proper representation of these consumers is necessary for democratized technological innovation. It is therefore imperative that efforts be made to increase representation from underprivileged communities.

            Recently, massive strides have been made to increase representation for female and minority students, while comparatively little effort has been made to increase representation from low-income and underprivileged communities. While these groups often overlap, it is important to directly address the fact that low-income and underprivileged communities have very little access to computer science education, and STEM education more broadly, compared to more privileged communities.
